# OpenSourceEvents-Frontend

This website contains a list of open source events and hackathons. They are in a proper month wise timeline so the user does not face difficulty while searching through the open source events. Most of the times students want to participate in the events but they dont know the dates or the event details. This repo contains links of the events and when are the events going to take place.
